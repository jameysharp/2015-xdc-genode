Hi Jamey,

this may be a strange way to reach you, but I don't see any other way right now. I
have watched your 2015-xdc-genode speech and got the impression that you know
what you are talking about. I also have tried to contact you on Twitter, but 144
letters are just not enough. So here is my actual concern: We have just enabled
the Broadwell architecture to support Mesa (OpenGL) and the i915 part of the
Linux kernel to work on Genode. It is done in the same fashion as the 2010
version by now. The next step would be to separate the driver from the clients,
since page-table handling and hardware contexts are all in place, this should be
possible. My goal is to not map the Linux DRM interface directly to a Genode
Session. Do you have any thoughts on how to achieve this.

Thank you and don't pull.
